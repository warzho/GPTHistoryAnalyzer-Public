# Chat Analysis Pipeline: HTML to JSON Migration Guide

## Overview
This guide walks you through migrating your chat analysis pipeline from HTML+JavaScript parsing to direct JSON processing. The refactoring removes approximately 200+ lines of HTML parsing code while maintaining all analytical capabilities. All HTML-specific tooling and diagnostics have been retired, so avoid reinstalling HTML parsing libraries when updating local environments.

## Step 1: Backup Your Current Project
Before making any changes, create a complete backup of your project:

```bash
cp -r your_project_folder your_project_folder_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## Step 2: Update Core Files

### 2.1 Replace `scripts/data_parser.py`
Replace your existing `data_parser.py` with the refactored version. The key changes:

**Removed:**
- `_parse_html_export()` method and all HTML parsing logic
- `_extract_conversations_from_text()` and related text extraction methods
- `_split_into_conversation_blocks()` method
- `_parse_text_conversation_block()` method
- `_clean_message_content()` method for HTML artifacts
- `_debug_text_parsing()` diagnostic method
- All HTML parsing dependencies

**Enhanced:**
- `_parse_json_export()` now handles multiple JSON formats
- Added `_extract_messages_from_mapping()` for nested structure traversal
- Added `_traverse_mapping_tree()` for proper message ordering
- Improved error messages specific to JSON issues

### 2.2 Update `config/analysis_config.py`
The configuration file needs minimal changes:

**Change:**
```python
# Old
CHAT_EXPORT_FILE = r"C:\Users\kidis\OneDrive\Documents\9-13-2025_Exported_WZ_chat.html"

# New
CHAT_EXPORT_FILE = r"C:\Users\kidis\OneDrive\Documents\9-13-2025_Exported_WZ_chat.json"
```

**Enhanced validation:**
- Now checks for `.json` extension
- Validates JSON format on load
- Provides helpful migration messages if HTML file exists

### 2.3 Update `scripts/utils.py`
Replace with the refactored version that includes:

**Updated:**
- `validate_file_exists()` now validates JSON format
- `print_setup_validation()` checks for JSON structure
- Added `migrate_html_to_json_config()` helper function
- Cost estimation optimized for JSON data

## Step 3: Update Entry Points

### 3.1 Use `run-staged-analysis.py`
The legacy `run_analysis.py` entry point has been replaced with `run-staged-analysis.py`.
This staged driver loads your JSON export, chunks it intelligently, submits batches
within queue-wide token budgets, and tracks progress so you can resume a run.

### 3.2 Use `synthesize_knowledge.py`
After all staged batches complete, run `synthesize_knowledge.py` to merge
`staged_results/combined_analysis.json` into a durable knowledge base.

## Step 4: Remove Deprecated Files

You can safely delete these files as they're no longer needed:
- Any lingering `html_diagnostics` utilities in local clones (removed from the repo)
- Any HTML test files in your test directory
- Backup HTML parsing utilities

## Step 5: Update Import Statements

Search your entire project for any HTML parsing imports and remove them to keep dependencies minimal.

## Step 6: Test the Migration

### 6.1 Validation Test
Run this simple test to ensure everything works:

```python
# test_migration.py
from scripts.data_parser import load_and_parse_chat_export
from config.analysis_config import AnalysisConfig

# Test loading JSON
conversations = load_and_parse_chat_export(AnalysisConfig.CHAT_EXPORT_FILE)
print(f"âœ… Successfully loaded {len(conversations)} conversations")

# Test first conversation structure
if conversations:
    first = conversations[0]
    print(f"First conversation: {first.get('title', 'Untitled')}")
    print(f"Messages: {len(first.get('messages', []))}")
```

### 6.2 Full Pipeline Test
Run the complete analysis with a small subset:

```bash
python run-staged-analysis.py --months 1
python synthesize_knowledge.py --input staged_results/combined_analysis.json
```

## Step 7: Performance Improvements

The JSON-only pipeline offers several performance benefits:

1. **Faster Loading**: Direct JSON parsing is ~10x faster than HTML parsing with JavaScript extraction
2. **Lower Memory Usage**: No need to load large HTML DOMs into memory
3. **Simpler Error Handling**: JSON validation is straightforward
4. **Cleaner Codebase**: ~40% reduction in parser code complexity

## Expected JSON Structure

Your JSON export should follow one of these formats:

### Format 1: Direct Array of Conversations
```json
[
  {
    "id": "conv_1",
    "title": "Project Discussion",
    "create_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "How do I start?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Here's how to begin..."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Format 2: ChatGPT Export with Mapping
```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc123",
    "title": "Technical Query",
    "create_time": 1234567890,
    "mapping": {
      "node_id_1": {
        "message": {
          "author": {"role": "user"},
          "content": {"parts": ["Question text"]}
        },
        "parent": null,
        "children": ["node_id_2"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### Format 3: Wrapped Conversations
```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "id": "conv_1",
      "title": "Discussion",
      "messages": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "File exists but is not valid JSON"
**Solution:** Validate your JSON at https://jsonlint.com/ and fix any syntax errors.

### Issue 2: "No conversations found in the export file"
**Solution:** Check that your JSON structure matches one of the expected formats above.

### Issue 3: "Chat export file must be a JSON file"
**Solution:** Update your `CHAT_EXPORT_FILE` path in `config/analysis_config.py` to use `.json` extension.

### Issue 4: Performance seems slower
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen. If it does, check that you're not accidentally still calling HTML parsing functions.

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Backed up original project
- [ ] Replaced `data_parser.py` with JSON-only version
- [ ] Updated `analysis_config.py` to reference `.json` file
- [ ] Updated `utils.py` with JSON validation
- [ ] Removed HTML parsing imports
- [ ] Deleted HTML-specific helper files
- [ ] Tested JSON loading successfully
- [ ] Ran a test analysis successfully
- [ ] Verified output matches expected format

## Benefits After Migration

1. **Cleaner Code**: Removed ~200+ lines of HTML parsing logic
2. **Better Performance**: 10x faster file loading
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Single data format to support
4. **Better Error Messages**: JSON validation provides clear error details
5. **Reduced Dependencies**: HTML parsing libraries are no longer required

## Next Steps

After successful migration:

1. Run a full analysis on your JSON data
2. Compare results with previous HTML-based analysis to ensure consistency
3. Consider optimizing your JSON export process for even better performance
4. Update any documentation to reflect JSON-only support

## Support

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. Check that your JSON is valid using an online validator
2. Ensure all file paths are updated to `.json` extensions
3. Verify that the JSON structure matches expected formats
4. Review error messages - they now provide JSON-specific guidance

Remember: The analysis logic and output format remain unchanged. Only the input parsing has been simplified!
